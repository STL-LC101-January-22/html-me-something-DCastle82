                 <h2>Ninjutsu</h2>
                 <p>
                    Ninjutsu (also know as Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu), is not just a martial art but a system of warfare.  Growing up in the 80's and 90's this style was made famous by The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.  It took until I was in my 30s to finally have a chance to study it.  Ninjutsu teaches a complete fighting art consisting of punches, kicks, throws, chokes, and weapons.  The style believes all training should be under real life conditions (no pads, full contact, and on unpadded terrain.) It is the last style I was able to study as it was the one that caused a tear in my menicus.

              <h2>Shaolin Kung Fu</h2>
              <p>
                 Shaolin Kung Fu (made famous by Disney's Kung Fu Panda), was a style that I started in my early 30s.  It has 5 animals in total (Tiger, Crane, Snake, Dragon, and Leopard), however the Tiger and Crane are the two most noted.  I grew up watching a show called Kung Fu the Legend Continues.  In it a Shaolin Monk named Caine went around China Town helping people and saving the day using kung fu.  While I knew that it was T.V. there was something about the movements that enamored me. It was in Edwardsville that I was able to find a master to teach me.  While I myself am not a master, I am qualified to teach the Tiger and Crane forms.
