                 <p>
                    Ninjutsu (also know as Bujikan Budo Taijutsu), is not just a martial art but a system of warfare.  Growing up in the 80's and 90's this style was made famous by The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.  It took until I was in my 30s to finally have a chance to study it.  Ninjutsu teaches to use everything you can as a weapon.
